The scripts are for 3D models for 3D printing.

An important aspect of this library is the CC0 (Public Domain) license.

Note: When using files from this library for a project that is published, then please add those library files to your project or copy the parts of the scripts that your use into your own script. This library might change and a future version might be incompatible with your script.
